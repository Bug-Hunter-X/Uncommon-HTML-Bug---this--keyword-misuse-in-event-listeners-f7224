# Uncommon HTML Bug: Unexpected 'this' Behavior in Event Listeners

This repository demonstrates a subtle but important bug related to the `this` keyword when using event listeners in JavaScript within an HTML context.  The bug arises from an incorrect understanding of how the `this` keyword is bound inside event listener callback functions. 

The primary issue is that `this` does not automatically refer to the element to which the event listener is attached unless properly bound. This can lead to unexpected results, especially when trying to access properties or methods of the target element.

## Bug Description

The `bug.html` file contains code that attempts to alert the ID of a div element when it's clicked. However, due to the incorrect use of `this`, the alert displays `undefined` instead of the expected ID, "myDiv". This is because `this` inside the callback function refers to the global object (window) instead of the div.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file shows the corrected code.  The solution ensures the correct context for the `this` keyword, resulting in the expected output when clicking the div element.

This example highlights the importance of understanding how `this` behaves in JavaScript's event handling mechanism and how to use it effectively to avoid unexpected outcomes.
